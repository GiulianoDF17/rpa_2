Project: music-organizer-v3. A project to collect audio files.
Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, remove, and play files. The listAllFiles
method prints a list of the collection.

From other Assignment:

25. If there was no matching file then what would've happened was that nothing was printed since the print value is (filename).
28. for(Track track : trackList){
    
}

Chapter 7:

24. copyOfRange: creates an array list and you need to put in an integer to get the numbers within the range.
    binarySearch: searches for the key that you need; example if you need to search a number and it's in index = 2, then the it will print out the index.
    fill: sets all the numbers in a specified value; example:
    int[] prices = new int[6]
    Array.fill(prices, 7);
    prices = {7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7}
    sort: it sorts all the numbers or names in order so that it can be better to read.
